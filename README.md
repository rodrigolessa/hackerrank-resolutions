# About the project
Here you will find solutions for LeetCode commun problems and unit tests to validate them.
I also created homemade implementations of some data structures using C# to in the algorithms. 
Feel free to contribute!

# Implemented Data Structures
- Graph
- Binary Tree
- Doubly Linked List
- Linked List
- Max Heap
- Min Heap (priority queue)
- Min Stack (easy to know the min value inserted)
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)

I will add more complexy data structures like:
- Dequeue
- HashMap

# Structure
The solution is divided in three projects:
- MyDataStructures (my homemade implementations of data structures)
- GetHandsDirty (LeetCode problems organized in folders by type or by data structures used to solve it)
- GetHandsDirty.UnitTests (to have proof that the solutions are truly effective in solving the problems)

# How to run the project
There is no user interface or interaction. The tests are simply executed, and the results can be checked. In a future implementation, I plan to create a report that presents the test results, organized by problem type and the strategies used to solve them.

```
dotnet test
```
It should run the test project and present the results.
