# Coding Challenges
üñ•Ô∏è This repository is dedicated to study and practice, focusing on solving diverse coding challenges with an emphasis on best practices.

## About the project
Here you will find solutions to common LeetCode problems along with unit tests for validation. I have also built custom implementations of some data structures in C# to support the algorithms.
Contributions are welcome!

## Implemented Data Structures
- Graph
- Binary Tree
- Doubly Linked List
- Linked List
- Max Heap
- Min Heap (priority queue)
- Min Stack (easy to know the min value inserted)
- Stack (LIFO)
- Queue (FIFO)

I will add more complexy data structures like:
- Dequeue
- HashMap

## Structure
The solution is divided in three projects:
- MyDataStructures (my homemade implementations of data structures)
- GetHandsDirty (LeetCode problems organized in folders by type or by data structures used to solve it)
- GetHandsDirty.UnitTests (to have proof that the solutions are truly effective in solving the problems)

## How to run the project
There is no user interface or interaction. The tests are simply executed, and the results can be checked. In a future implementation, I plan to create a report that presents the test results, organized by problem type and the strategies used to solve them.

```
dotnet test
```
It should run the test project and present the results.

## Let‚Äôs Build Together

üöß If you notice any opportunities for improvement in coding, structure, or best practices, please let me know - I am always eager to learn..

‚ùå Contributions are welcome! If you‚Äôd like to add new solved challenges, feel free to open a pull request so we can improve this project together.
